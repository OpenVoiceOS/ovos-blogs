## Building Trust Through Visibility: Self-Hosted Rybbit Analytics Platform

OpenVoiceOS applies a strict standard to any component that processes user-facing metrics: it must be open, inspectable, and aligned with a minimal-data philosophy. To meet these requirements, we have integrated [**Rybbit**](https://rybbit.com), a privacy-focused, open-source analytics platform, into our web infrastructure, **we operate our own self-hosted Rybbit instance**.

This resolves a fundamental need. We require analytics to understand operational load, documentation usage, and community interaction, but we will not outsource this responsibility to opaque, third-party services. Traditional analytics platforms introduce cookies, identifiers, and external data pipelines that do not align with our governance model.

## Why Rybbit

[Rybbit](https://rybbit.com) meets the criteria for a trustworthy analytics layer:

* **Fully open source** under AGPL-3.0, enabling community review.
* **Cookieless, privacy-respecting design**, avoiding persistent user identifiers.
* **Event-based tracking**, suitable for objective behavioral metrics without profiling.
* **Straightforward self-hosting**, enabling OVOS to retain full control of data at rest and in transit.

This aligns with the same philosophy that drives OVOS: open systems, verifiable behavior, and community oversight.

By running our own instance, we eliminate reliance on external infrastructure and maintain a clear, auditable chain of data custody.

## Public Access to All Metrics

Consistent with OVOS policy, the analytics output is public and unfiltered. Anyone can inspect exactly what is collected:

* **Main Site Analytics**: [https://analytics.tigregotico.pt/3](https://analytics.tigregotico.pt/3)
* **Blog Analytics**: [https://analytics.tigregotico.pt/4](https://analytics.tigregotico.pt/4)

These dashboards provide real-time visibility into the same metrics we use internally: page traffic, navigation flows, referrers, and high-level usage events. There is no private reporting layer and no hidden data.

This structure is intentional. Transparency is not meaningful unless it is verifiable by external observers and the system itself is visible end-to-end.

## How OVOS Utilizes the Data

The scope of analytics at OVOS is narrow and operational:

* Page view counts inform documentation planning and community engagement analysis.
* Path and navigation metrics help validate site layout decisions.
* Referrer analysis identifies integration points and discovery pathways.
* Anonymous event counts support content prioritization.

We do not engage in fingerprinting, advertising metrics, cohort segmentation, or user-level tracking. Retention is kept minimal, and data is anonymized by design.

Deploying a self-hosted instance of Rybbit strengthens our commitment to verifiable transparency. The system provides the operational insight we require without compromising privacy or introducing unreviewable dependencies. 

More importantly, it enables the community to audit what we collect and confirm what we do not collect, directly and continuously.
