# Teaching Voice Assistants to Understand Color

Color is something we all *see*, but teaching machines to *understand* it is surprisingly hard.

Voice assistants like OpenVoiceOS are designed to respond naturally when you say things like:

> “Change the lamp color to moss green.”  
> “Make it darker.”  
> “A bit more yellowish.”  
> “Perfect.”

At first glance, this sounds simple: detect the color word, map it to an RGB value, and send it to your smart bulb.  
But human color language isn’t simple. It’s ambiguous, cultural, emotional and sometimes even *physically impossible*.

Let’s explore why understanding color in natural speech is such a fascinating challenge.

## Color, Language, and Human Weirdness

When you say “green,” what do you actually mean?  
Is it the bright green of a traffic light? The pale green of mint leaves? Or the dark, mossy shade of a forest floor?

Even humans don’t agree. The same word can describe vastly different points in [color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space).  
Some languages even *merge* what English separates, for example, many don’t distinguish between “blue” and “green.” Linguists call this blend **[grue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue–green_distinction_in_language)**.

In some cultures, there are only two or three color words total. For example:

- The **[Bassa language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassa_language_(Liberia))** has only two color terms: *ziza* (warm colors) and *hui* (cool colors).
- The **Ovahimba** of Namibia use just four, grouping what English would consider unrelated hues together.
- Russian splits “blue” into two distinct colors: *синий* (*sinii*, dark blue) and *голубой* (*goluboi*, light blue).

So when a user says, “Turn the light blue-green,” what does that really mean? Depending on your cultural or linguistic background, “blue-green” could mean turquoise, teal, cyan or something else entirely.

## The Physics Problem: Impossible Colors

Color also depends on physics and biology; some colors simply *can’t* exist.

Take “reddish-green” or “yellowish-blue.” Our visual system processes color through **[opponent channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process)**; red vs. green, blue vs. yellow. Because of this, our brains can’t perceive both at once.

So if a user jokingly says:

> “Hey OVOS, make the lamp fluorescent greenish-yellow-purple!”

What should it do? No such color exists in the visible spectrum. Physically, fluorescent greenish-yellow and purple are opposite wavelengths of light, they cancel each other out.

But a voice assistant still has to *respond* somehow. It can’t say, “That violates the laws of photometry,” even if that’s true.

## The Subtlety of Everyday Speech

Humans rarely describe color in strict technical terms like “set hue to 180°.” Instead, we use fuzzy, relational descriptions:

> “Make it a little darker.”  
> “Can you make it warmer?”  
> “That’s too pale, brighten it up.”  
> “A softer pink, please.”

Each of these phrases carries multiple implied adjustments:

- **“Darker”** → lower brightness  
- **“Warmer”** → shift hue toward red or yellow  
- **“Pale”** → reduce saturation  
- **“Soft”** → lower both saturation and brightness  

These aren’t direct commands they’re *interpretations*. To follow them, a voice assistant must understand the relationships between **[hue, saturation, brightness, and temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)**, concepts that even humans find tricky to define precisely.

## Color Is Contextual

Even when two people look at the same light, they may perceive different colors depending on context and lighting conditions.  
The same “white” light might feel warm in a cozy living room but cold in an office.

Cultural and emotional associations play a role too; in Western culture, “red” feels hot, but in physics, it’s literally *cooler* than blue. ([Color temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) flips our intuition: blue light comes from hotter objects.)

So when a user says:

> “Set the lights to a cozy orange.”

The assistant must interpret *“cozy”* not as a number, but as a mood, perhaps a dim, amber hue that feels warm and inviting. That’s a surprisingly human task for a machine.

## The Technical Gap

Computers think in numbers, [RGB values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), hex codes, or wavelengths in nanometers. Humans think in words, moods, and metaphors.

Bridging that gap means:

- Mapping fuzzy language (“slightly more vibrant”) into measurable values.  
- Handling cultural differences in color naming.  
- Avoiding physically impossible colors.  
- Maintaining consistent behavior even when users don’t.

That’s a tall order for a system built to *talk*, not *see.*

## Enter the OVOS Color Parser

To help with this problem we created [**OVOS Color Parser**](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-color-parser), a lightweight toolkit that helps voice assistants interpret color descriptions in natural language.

It takes utterances like:

> “Make it slightly warmer and more saturated.”  
> “Turn the light to pale pink.”  
> “I want a deep, muted blue.”

…and turns them into meaningful color objects with **[RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model)** or **[HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)** values.

Here’s what it does under the hood:

1. **Language Parsing** – Scans your utterance for known color terms (like “red,” “turquoise,” or “chartreuse”) and modifiers (like “bright,” “muted,” or “warm”).  
2. **Cultural Mapping** – Matches those terms to a multilingual color database of thousands of named colors, cross-referenced with color theory and linguistic datasets.  
3. **Color Composition** – Computes approximate values in RGB space, adjusting for *saturation*, *brightness*, *temperature*, and even *opacity* if mentioned.  
4. **Fallbacks and “Impossible Colors”** – If you ask for something nonsensical (“yellowish purple”), it still produces a best guess, balancing the color wheel and returning something plausible, or at least interesting.  

It even understands scientific phrasing like:

> “Set the lamp wavelength to 470 nanometers.”

## Why This Matters

Voice interaction is supposed to be *human*.  
When you ask your assistant for a “vibrant, warm red,” you’re expressing a feeling, not a number.

By teaching machines to understand how we talk about color, we’re closing the gap between human expression and machine precision.

The **OVOS Color Parser** doesn’t just map colors, it maps *language* to *perception.*  
It’s one more step toward assistants that understand not just what we say, but what we *mean.*

**In short:** color is a beautifully human mix of physics, culture, and emotion; and helping OVOS understand it is part of what makes open voice technology so endlessly fascinating.
