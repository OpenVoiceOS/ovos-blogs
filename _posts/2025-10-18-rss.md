## OpenVoiceOS Blog Launches RSS Feed ‚Äî A Win for Accessibility & Open Standards

We‚Äôre happy to announce that the **OVOS (OpenVoiceOS)** blog now supports a **RSS / Atom feed** at:

üëâ [https://blog.openvoiceos.org/feed.xml](https://blog.openvoiceos.org/feed.xml)

This may look like a small technical change, but in reality it‚Äôs a big step forward ‚Äî especially from the perspective of accessibility, interoperability, and empowering users. Below are a few reasons why we believe RSS is still relevant and why adding a feed is aligned with our vision.

## Why RSS Still Matters in 2025

Yes, RSS is old technology, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs obsolete. Here are a few reasons it continues to deserve a place in the modern web ecosystem:

1. **Decentralized content subscription**
   RSS gives users control. Instead of being locked into one platform‚Äôs algorithm or interface, people can choose their own feed reader or aggregator. You subscribe once, and updates come to *you*, not the other way around.

2. **Low overhead, simple format**
   RSS / Atom feeds are lightweight XML documents. They don‚Äôt need heavy frameworks, JavaScript, or APIs. That means lower bandwidth, faster performance, and more compatibility with devices and assistive technologies.

3. **Resilience & longevity**
   Since RSS is an open standard, it‚Äôs not tied to any one company or service. If a blog or website changes its front-end, the feed often remains a stable outlet for updates. That robustness is valuable for archival, backup, and long-term content access.

4. **Interoperability & portability**
   RSS works across platforms, apps, and ecosystems. Want to surface blog posts in your smart home panel, or integrate them into your voice assistant? A feed makes that straightforward. You don‚Äôt have to reverse-engineer HTML pages or depend on ad-hoc APIs.

5. **Accessibility-friendly**
   This is especially important for OVOS and the intersection of voice, assistive tech, and open systems. Many feed readers are designed to work well with screen readers, text-to-speech tools, or simple ‚Äúnext item‚Äù navigation. Because RSS is structured, semantic, and minimal, assistive software can more reliably parse it.

## Accessibility & Open Standards: Why We Care

At OVOS, our mission is to push toward more open, user-empowering voice and assistant systems. We believe accessibility is not an afterthought, it should be baked into every layer. Supporting an RSS feed is consistent with that philosophy:

* **Equal access to content**: Users who rely on assistive tech (screen readers, braille displays, voice-driven readers) should be able to consume blog updates just as easily as sighted users. Structured feeds help.
* **Choice in how you consume**: Whether you prefer to read in a browser, within a reader app, or have updates read out to you, RSS gives you options.
* **Standards matter**: Open standards promote interoperability and reduce handshake friction between systems. We‚Äôd rather everyone ‚Äúspeak RSS / Atom‚Äù than build brittle, custom bridges.
* **Future-proofing**: We want the OVOS blog to remain accessible and usable even if web frameworks change, hosting changes, or site redesigns happen. The feed is a thread through all of that.

## How You Can Use the New Feed

Here are a few ideas to take advantage of the new RSS feed:

* **Add it to your favorite news / feed reader** (e.g. Feedly, Inoreader, Thunderbird) so new posts show up automatically.
* **Use it in automation or scripting**: For example, fetch new posts via a lightweight script, push them to your personal dashboard, or trigger voice notifications.
* **Integrate with voice assistants**: If you build a skill/plugin in OVOS or another system, you can parse the feed and let people ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new on the blog?‚Äù rather than scraping HTML.
* **Share / mirror**: You could mirror or aggregate OVOS content into your own blog or archive, thanks to the open nature of RSS.

## Next Steps

* We‚Äôll monitor for feedback, if the feed has issues, we‚Äôll fix them.
* Consider expanding meta-data in feed items: more tags, categories, summaries, thumbnails, etc., to make it richer for readers and integrations.
* Encourage third-party projects in the OVOS ecosystem to use the feed for cross-linking, showing blog snippets in dashboards, or exposing blog summaries in voice UI.

If you come across any issues subscribing or using the feed, or have ideas for enhancements, please let us know.

Thank you for being part of the OVOS community! May your blog updates come to *you*, seamlessly and accessibly.

## Help Us Build Voice for Everyone

OpenVoiceOS is more than software, it‚Äôs a mission. If you believe voice assistants should be open, inclusive, and user-controlled, here‚Äôs how you can help:

- **üí∏ Donate**: Help us fund development, infrastructure, and legal protection.
- **üì£ Contribute Open Data**: Share voice samples and transcriptions under open licenses.
- **üåç Translate**: Help make OVOS accessible in every language.

We're not building this for profit. We're building it for people. With your support, we can keep voice tech transparent, private, and community-owned.
