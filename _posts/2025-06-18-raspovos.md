We‚Äôre excited to introduce **raspOVOS**, a ready-to-use Raspberry Pi image that brings the power of OpenVoiceOS (OVOS) to your fingertips. Whether you‚Äôre a developer building next-generation voice assistants or a curious user wanting a local, private smart speaker, raspOVOS is your ideal starting point.

### üöÄ What is raspOVOS?

raspOVOS is a heavily customized version of Raspberry Pi OS that transforms your Raspberry Pi into a fully functional, offline-capable voice assistant. 

Built using [dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier](https://github.com/dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier), it automates the setup process and ensures every system is preconfigured with OpenVoiceOS services, dependencies, and performance tweaks.

We‚Äôve split raspOVOS into three distinct editions to better match the capabilities of each Raspberry Pi model and your preferred use case:

- üåê **[Online Edition](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases/tag/raspOVOS-bookworm-arm64-lite-2025-06-18)** _(RPi 3 optimized)_
  Lightweight and cloud-reliant, perfect for older hardware. Uses online speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) for minimal CPU usage and lower memory demands. Some advanced features like media-to-voice and common query intent pipelines are not available in this version.
  
- ‚ö° **[Hybrid Edition](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases/tag/raspOVOS-bookworm-arm64-hybrid-2025-06-18)** _(RPi 4 optimized)_
  A balance of performance and flexibility. Offline text-to-speech (TTS) with online speech-to-text (STT). The best compromise without maxing out memory or computing resources.
  
- üìµ **[Offline Edition](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases/tag/raspOVOS-bookworm-arm64-offline-2025-06-18)** _(RPi 5 optimized)_
  Fully self-contained voice assistant. Runs everything locally including speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS). Perfect for privacy-focused setups or when internet connectivity is unreliable.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/51-install_raspovos) for detailed instructions.

### üôå A User-Friendly Entry Point

raspOVOS isn‚Äôt just for developers, it's also the perfect solution for everyday users who want to use OpenVoiceOS without any technical hassle. Flash the image, plug in a mic and speaker, power up, and you‚Äôre greeted by an OVOS assistant ready to help.

Out of the box, raspOVOS:

* Logs in automatically as the `ovos` user (password: `ovos`)
* Starts all OVOS services at boot
* Includes all default OVOS skills
* Fully pre-configured for multiple languages including English, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Italian, and more

---

### üí° Smart Design Choices

Under the hood, raspOVOS does a lot to ensure a reliable experience:

* Custom user `ovos` with appropriate permissions (`sudo`, `audio`, etc.)
* Audio and media stack tuned for voice interactions
* Preloaded models to avoid the need for a huge download on first boot
* Splash screen and I2C audio board support
* Improved system performance via ZRAM and optimized boot settings

For advanced users, self-hosting your own [STT](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/200-stt_server/) and [TTS](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/201-tts_server/) servers is encouraged for privacy and performance.

### üß™ A Developer Reference Platform

For developers, raspOVOS serves as a standardized foundation to build, test, and deploy OVOS-based voice applications. 

It ships with preinstalled development tools, preloaded language models, and a complete audio stack including PipeWire and DLNA support.

## Help Us Build Voice for Everyone

If you believe that voice assistants should be open, inclusive, and user-controlled, we invite you to support OVOS:

* **üí∏ Donate**: Your contributions help us pay for infrastructure, development, and legal protections.

* **üì£ Contribute Open Data**: Speech models need diverse, high-quality data. If you can share voice samples, transcripts, or datasets under open licenses, let‚Äôs collaborate.

* **üåç Help Translate**: OVOS is global by nature. Translators make our platform accessible to more communities every day.

We‚Äôre not building this for profit. We‚Äôre building it for people. And with your help, we can ensure open voice has a future‚Äîtransparent, private, and community-owned.
