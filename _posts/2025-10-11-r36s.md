# Running HiveMind Player on ArkOS with the R36S

The **R36S** handheld from AliExpress is usually marketed as a retro gaming device, but with a bit of tinkering it can also become a **HiveMind-powered audio player**, fully integrated with **Home Assistant** and **Music Assistant** 🎶.

This guide shows how I set up the `hivemind-player` on **ArkOS** and turned my device into a smart media endpoint.

## Why HiveMind Player?

HiveMind Player lets you run the **Open Voice OS (OVOS)** audio stack as a service. Once configured, your R36S:

* Appears as a **media player in Home Assistant** 🏡
* Works seamlessly with **Music Assistant** 🎵
* Uses **OpenVoiceOS** for playback control (play, pause, next, etc.)
* Can handle TTS and system volume if you install the right plugins

See the [HiveMind Player README](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/hivemind-player) for full technical details.

## Step 1: Flash ArkOS

I used [arkos4clone](https://github.com/lcdyk0517/arkos4clone) to install ArkOS on my [**R36 Ultra**](https://handhelds.wiki/R36_Ultra).

⚠️ Compatibility and initial steps may vary across **clone devices**, since there are many hardware variations. This guide applies to ArkOS-based firmware but assumes your handheld is already fully functional before starting.

👉 Always follow the **specific instructions from your image provider**, and check [handhelds.wiki](https://handhelds.wiki) for the latest community documentation.

Once ArkOS is up:

* Connect to WiFi from the device menu
* Enable **Remote Services**
* SSH into the device from a computer

## Step 2: Install `uv`

We’ll use [uv](https://astral.sh/uv) for managing Python environments and dependencies:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
```

---

## Step 3: Install System Packages

ArkOS strips out many development headers, so we need to reinstall them.

Without these, I ran into some confusing build errors when trying to install plugins for volume control, including:

```text
fatal error: limits.h: No such file or directory
fatal error: linux/limits.h: No such file or directory
fatal error: alsa/asoundlib.h: No such file or directory
```

These were resolved by reinstalling the right dev packages:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libffi-dev libssl-dev gcc libc6-dev
sudo apt install --reinstall libc6-dev linux-libc-dev libasound2-dev
```

Then install Python build tools:

```bash
uv pip install wheel
```

---

## Step 4: Install HiveMind Player

Install the player with recommended extras (e.g., VLC, PHAL, OCP, TTS):

uv pip install git+https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/hivemind-media-player[extras]
```

---

## Step 5: Configure HiveMind Core

Create a config directory and set up the `server.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/hivemind-core/
nano ~/.config/hivemind-core/server.json
```

Example minimal configuration:

```json5
{
  "agent_protocol": {
    "module": "hivemind-player-agent-plugin",
    "hivemind-player-agent-plugin": {}
  },
  "network_protocol": {
    "hivemind-websocket-plugin": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 5678
    },
    "hivemind-http-plugin": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 5679
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 6: Optional — Extra Plugins

You may want to install **PHAL plugins** for platform and hardware integration, or **TTS plugins** to use different voices

Currently the most useful is the **ALSA plugin** for system volume control:

```bash
uv pip install ovos-tts-plugin-piper ovos-phal-plugin-alsa ovos-PHAL-plugin-system
```

This makes volume adjustable via HiveMind / Home Assistant.

👉 PHAL is **optional**. Right now it’s only needed for volume control - and, as shown above, it required a lot of dev headers just to build. In the future, **dedicated plugins** may appear, for example to control the **joystick LEDs** on the R36 Ultra.

---

## Step 7: Configure `ovos-audio`

HiveMind Player uses the **OVOS audio stack** for playback and TTS. The configuration lives in:

```bash
~/.config/mycroft/mycroft.conf
```

The main change required on ArkOS is adjusting the **WAV playback command**:

* By default, `mycroft.conf` uses `paplay`
* On ArkOS, this needs to be switched to **`aplay`** in order for TTS to work correctly

```json5
{
  "play_wav_cmdline": "aplay %1",
  "play_mp3_cmdline": "mpg123 %1",
  "play_ogg_cmdline": "ogg123 -q %1",

  "tts": {
    "module": "ovos-tts-plugin-piper",
    "ovos-tts-plugin-piper": {"voice": "alan-low"}
  },

  "Audio": {
    "backends": {
      "vlc": {
        "type": "vlc",
        "active": true,
        "initial_volume": 100,
        "low_volume": 50
      }
    }
  },

  "PHAL": {
    "ovos-PHAL-plugin-alsa": {
      "default_volume": 90
    },
    "ovos-PHAL-plugin-system": {
      "core_service": "hivemind-player.service",
      "ssh_service": "ssh.service",
      "sudo": true
    }
  }
}
```

* **play_wav_cmdline** → must be changed to `aplay %1`
* **Audio** → VLC is already available in ArkOS and can play nearly all streams you throw at it
* **TTS** → Default is `ovos-tts-plugin-piper`, but you can swap in any OVOS TTS plugin you prefer such as  `ovos-tts-plugin-server`
* **PHAL** → system plugin needs to be adjusted in order to use the correct service names

> NOTE: in arkOS sudo does not require password, therefore `ovos-PHAL-plugin-system` should work out of the box

## Step 8: Set Up Permissions

HiveMind operates on a `deny-all` policy by default: every message type must be explicitly allowed for clients.

First, create a client identity:

```bash
hivemind-core add-client
```

This gives you an **Access Key** and **Password**.

Next, allow the minimum messages needed for playback and TTS. Replace `<NODE_ID>` with the client’s Node ID:

```bash
# Basic audio / TTS
hivemind-core allow-msg "speak" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.audio.is_alive" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.audio.is_ready" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.audio.speak.status" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.stop" <NODE_ID>

# Common Play (playback control)
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.play" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.pause" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.resume" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.stop" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.next" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.previous" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.player.status" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "ovos.common_play.track_info" <NODE_ID>

# Optional: volume (PHAL ALSA plugin)
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.get" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.set" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.increase" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.decrease" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.mute" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "mycroft.volume.unmute" <NODE_ID>

# Optional: SSH, Reboot and Shutdown (PHAL system plugin)
hivemind-core allow-msg "system.ssh.status" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "system.ssh.enable" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "system.ssh.disable" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "system.reboot" <NODE_ID>
hivemind-core allow-msg "system.shutdown" <NODE_ID>

```

---

## Step 9: Create a System Service

To keep HiveMind Player running in the background, add a **systemd user service**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/hivemind-player.service
```

Paste this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HiveMind Player
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ark
ExecStart=/home/ark/.venv/bin/python /home/ark/.venv/bin/hivemind-core listen
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then enable and start it:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable hivemind-player.service --now
systemctl --user status hivemind-player.service
```

---

## Step 10: Optional - Install tailscale for remote access

A problem we have with the R36S is that it changes IP address on every boot and randomizes its MAC address; to work around this we could try to assign a static IP address but since this is a handheld and will often be on the move, why not use a VPN?

[tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is free and painless to install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo systemctl enable tailscaled
sudo tailscale login
sudo systemctl start tailscaled
sudo systemctl status tailscaled
```

Now we have a static ip address AND we can access the handheld remotely


---

## Step 11: Integrate with Home Assistant

With the [hivemind-homeassistant](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/hivemind-homeassistant) integration installed, your R36 Ultra shows up as a **media player** inside Home Assistant.

![R36 device in Home Assistant](/assets/blog/r36s/ha_device.png)

In Home Assistant, the TTS setup also makes the device available as a **notify entity**, so you can send text notifications and have them spoken on your R36 Ultra:

```yaml
service: notify.hivemind_player
data:
  message: "Dinner is ready!"
```

![R36 notify in Home Assistant](/assets/blog/r36s/ha_notify.png)

Combine this with **Music Assistant** and suddenly your retro handheld doubles as a WiFi speaker you can control from your smart home dashboard.

## Wrap-Up

That’s it! My R36 Ultra, originally built for emulation, now runs **HiveMind Player** on ArkOS and integrates seamlessly with my smart home setup.

* HiveMind manages the player backend
* Home Assistant discovers it
* Music Assistant lets me browse and stream to it
* `ovos-audio` makes it flexible for both playback and TTS
* Optional PHAL plugins give extra control (volume now, LEDs in the future)
* Permissions ensure only trusted clients can control it

A fun way to repurpose cheap handheld hardware into a **smart speaker alternative**! 🚀
