# OpenVoiceOS Receives NGI Zero Commons Fund Grant

We’re excited to share some fantastic news — **OpenVoiceOS (OVOS)** has been selected to receive a grant from the [**NGI Zero Commons Fund**](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero-commons-fund/)!

This milestone represents a huge step forward for our mission to build an open, community-driven, and **privacy-first** voice assistant platform. With this support, we can accelerate our progress from beta to a first stable version under our OpenVoiceOS umbrella.

---

## What is OpenVoiceOS?

**OVOS** is Europe’s open-source alternative to proprietary voice assistants.
Built around transparency, modularity, and user freedom, OVOS lets you choose every component of your assistant — from **wake word** and **speech recognition** to **text-to-speech**, **intent handling**, and **AI conversation modules** — all while keeping full control over your data.

You can run OVOS **entirely offline**, **on-premises**, or **in the cloud**, making it suitable for:

- Smart homes and IoT devices
- Accessibility and assistive technologies
- Industrial and enterprise applications
- Research and educational environments

---

## What the Grant Enables

With support from the NGI Zero Commons Fund, we’ll be able to:

- 💼 **Hire our lead developer** to deliver on the first stable roadmap
- 🧭 **Improve onboarding** and usability for non-technical users
- 🌍 **Expand language support** and stabilize platform components
- 📚 **Enhance documentation** for developers building skills and plug-ins

---

## Real-World Impact

OVOS is already making a difference across Europe and beyond.
It powers projects such as the [**Royal Dutch Visio Voicelab**](https://voicelab.visio.org/), bringing voice interaction to visually impaired users, as well as conversational assistants in [**nursing homes**](https://khoshnazdesign.com/Fritzi/), [**manufacturing**](https://coala-ai.de/), and/ or [**multilingual AI initiatives**](https://proyectoilenia.es/recursos-modelos-datasets/).

This grant helps us strengthen that ecosystem — empowering developers, researchers, and users to shape the future of open, ethical voice technology.

Your support makes it possible to keep building a voice assistant platform that prioritizes **freedom**, **transparency**, and **privacy**.

Together, we’re proving that open voice technology can be **trustworthy**, **user-owned**, and **truly free**.

Stay tuned for more updates as we move toward our full **first stable release**!

## Help Us Build Voice for Everyone 

If you believe that voice assistants should be open, inclusive, and user-controlled, we invite you to support OVOS: 

- **💸 Donate**: Your contributions help us pay for infrastructure, development, and legal protections. 

- **📣 Contribute Open Data**: Speech models need diverse, high-quality data. If you can share voice samples, transcripts, or datasets under open licenses, let's collaborate. 

- **🌍 Help Translate**: OVOS is global by nature. Translators make our platform accessible to more communities every day. 

We're not building this for profit. We're building it for people. And with your help, we can ensure open voice has a future—transparent, private, and community-owned.
